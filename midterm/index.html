            <h1> About Us</h1>

            <p> Like many endeavors, the genesis of Sodoi spans back centuries. Jae Chung, Bob Baldwin,
            and Robert Hensley have nearly 100 years of combined experience in coffee trading, roasting,
            blending and serving. In addition, their mentors have passed knowledge gained from a lifetime
            in the coffee industry. Sodoi stands firmly on a foundation of 200 years combined industry
            expertise. Our knowledgeable, consumer-oriented and skilled team provides you with the best
                quality product and customer service. </p>
                <p>
                Sodoi’s deeply rooted history extends back generations.
            Bob and Robert have been honored to call Alfred Peet (founder of Peet’s Coffee & Tea) a
            mentor and friend. In addition to acquiring the vast knowledge and experience by working
            with Mr. Peet, Bob and Robert worked for Probat Burns, a German roasting company founded in
            1864. Together, they built, restored, installed, and trained on roasting equipment, which
            extended from vintage machines of the early 20th century to the most refined and advanced
            roasting equipment built today.</p>
