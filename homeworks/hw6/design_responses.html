					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> There are a lot more things to consider in animation than I had thought. Many animation decisions are
							very micro but make a large difference. Humans are able to perceive small differences that seem off. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I liked how the article included examples of good vs bad design practices.
							It was a little difficult for me to tell the difference at times. I would have to rewatch the
							animations to see the subtle differences. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Imitating the behavior of objects from the real world we can create a sequence
								that allows users to understand what to expect from the interface."</p>
						</li>
