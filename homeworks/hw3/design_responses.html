							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Fonts should be chosen based on their intended purpose and audience. Children may find certain fonts easier to read than seniors.
							Additionally, contrasting fonts can be paired together. </p>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I thought it was cool how you could use the golden ratio to pick harmonizing font sizes. It is really interesting to me how
							math can be used for making an aesthetic decision. The modular scale was also unique since it is based on nature and music. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "The Modular Scale method uses mathematical precision in order to generate font sizes. However, itâ€™s only a guide.
								Use this method as a starting point and then adjust sizes with your eye."
