							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Color contrast is very important for accessibility. If there is not enough of a contrast,
							it is difficult for people to read text and gain information. There are different
							tools available to test out contrast levels. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I liked how the article gave examples for what is good practice and what is not.
							For example, it showed what low contrast and high contrast looks like. It also gave an
							example of not just using color to signal an error but also including symbols. </p>

							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
